/// A delegate that can be provided to `NKPersistentContainer` or `NKPersistentCloudKitContainer`
/// to receive events describing the progress of migrations. These events can be used to update a user
/// interface or for app internal logging.
///
/// All methods are called while `NKPersistentContainer.loadPersistentStores(...)` is active.
/// If *any* of the `NSPersistentStoreDescription`s have the `shouldAddStoreAsynchronously` flag
/// set to `true` then all methods are called on a private background queue. If all of the store
/// descriptions have the flag set to `false` then the methods are called on the same queue on which
/// `NKPersistentContainer.loadPersistentStores(...)` was called.
///
/// The stores in `NKPersistentContainer.persistentStoreDescriptions` are processed sequentially.
/// Stores that are not migratable (not on disk) are ignored and do not represent in this delegate.
///
/// A store that does not require migration (the normal case!) sees the sequence:
///
///  1. willConsiderStore
///  2. willNotMigrateStore
///
/// A store requiring a 2-step migration sees the sequence:
///
///  1. willConsiderStore
///  2. willMigrateStore - totalSteps=2
///  3. willSingleMigrateStore - stepsRemaining=2
///  4. willSingleMigrateStore - stepsRemaining=1
///  5. didMigrateStore
///
/// Errors can occur at any point following `willConsiderStore` for example:
///
///  1. willConsiderStore
///  2. willMigrateStore - totalSteps=8
///  3. didFailToMigrateStore
